UCI HAR Dataset Analysis
========================

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

## Requirements

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files

[run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script - The R script that was used for analysis.

[CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md) file - Describes the data of the means_by_activity_and_subject.txt and the steps used to create it.

[means_by_activity_and_subject.txt](means_by_activity_and_subject.txt) file - contains the tidy dataset created by run_analysis.R script

[full_tidy_dataset.txt](full_tidy_dataset.txt) file - contains the full dataset created during run_analysis.R script run (see more data in CodeBook.md)

[UCI HAR Dataset](UCI HAR Dataset) folder - contains the original data.
